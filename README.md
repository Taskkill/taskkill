### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'am John and I'm interested in PL and Type Systems related stuff.

Some of my favourite work:

- [JS DSL for implementating Deterministic Finite State Machines](https://github.com/Taskkill/dfsm-dsl)
- [simple programming language with Damas-Hindley-Milner type inference](https://github.com/Taskkill/frea)
- [three simple REPLs of various lambda calculi](https://github.com/Taskkill/lambdas)
- [REPL for small and simple logic programming language inspired by Prolog](https://github.com/Taskkill/monolog)
- [very simple compiler from lisp-like programming language inspired by JS](https://github.com/Taskkill/sjs)
- [interpreter and (incomplete) VM for small programming language inspired by Feeny and ML](https://github.com/Taskkill/FeenyML)
- [core module of the Lambdulus - the Î»-calculus evaluator/programming environment](https://github.com/lambdulus/core)
